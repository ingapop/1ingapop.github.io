In an ideal world, researchers interested in groups in space would study groups in space. They would collect primary data from astronauts before, during, and after the flight. But in reality, these data are hard to access, sample sizes are very small, and the only place to study such groups is the International Space Station.Thus, researchers rely to a great extent on studying groups in other places that share some characteristics with spaceflight – space analogs.   

Space analog studies can be conducted in places that already exist for another purpose:  Arctic and Antarctic research stations, submarines, oil rigs, or national parks during offseason. Alternatively, space analogs can be specifically designed to replicate parts of spaceflight or space settlement experience (Bishop 2012; Caldwell 1990; Harrison, Clearwater, and McKay 1991).  
 
Most of space analog environments share the following characteristics: 1) high reliance on technology for life support and tasks; 2) socialand physical isolation; 3) high risk and dangerous consequences of failure; 4) high physiological, psychological, social, and cognitive demands; 5) importance of human-human, human-technology, and human-environment interaction; and 6) critical importance of team coordination, cooperation, and communication (Bishop 2012).  

Space analog environments are not ideal replicas of spaceflight environment, especially  regarding physical danger and isolation. Research in this area focuses on comparing people’s experiences, and not environments themselves, and there is an ongoing debate on generalizability of findings to different populations in different space analog environments (Bishop 2012; Suedfeld 1991).
