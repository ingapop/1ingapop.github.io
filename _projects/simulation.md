I will be a member of 8 people international crew that will simulate human operations on Mars at the Mars Desert Research Station. For two weeks, we will live as if on Mars: stay in an 8-meter diameter circular hab, put on simulated space suits every time we go outside, recycle our water, and eat shelf-stable food. 
During simulation, I will conduct participant observation and collect data on gender, status, and group dynamics.
