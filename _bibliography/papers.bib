abstract="In this chapter, the authors document the extent of disparities across racial groups and for international and immigrant students in campus climate for diversity, academic support, and financial conditions; examine the association between these campus experiences and academic outcomes; and explore whether the impacts of these campus experiences are stronger for historically underrepresented racial groups, immigrant, and/or international students. The authors discover that while international students have much lower rates of financial strain, the negative impact of financial strain is stronger for international students. The authors also find that immigrant students report higher levels of financial strain, however worrying about personal and family debt is unexpectedly associated with accumulating more credits and a higher likelihood of graduation.",
