I have a PhD from the department of Sociology& Criminology at the  University of Iowa. I wrote my dissertation on emotions, gender, and status in space analog environments (download my CV [here](assets/pdf/inga popovaite_vita_dec_2021.pdf) ). I speak Lithuanian, Russian, and a bit of Georgian and German.  

In my freetime, I bike, swim, read, knit, and make things with Raspberry Pi.   

Contact me if:

* 	You are looking for a data scientist with a strong social / behavioral science background;
* 	You are planning a research project and my expertise would be a great fit;
* 	You want to hear about my personal / research experience in a space analog environment;
* 	You are interested in my work and simply want to say hi.
