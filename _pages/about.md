I am a PhD candidate at the department of Sociology& Criminology at the  University of Iowa. I study emotions, gender, and status in space analog environments (download my CV [here](assets/pdf/inga popovaite_vita_feb_2021.pdf) ). I speak Lithuanian, Russian, and a bit of Georgian and German.  

When I am not behind my computer, I bike, swim, and read.   

Do you have questions that are not covered in this blog? Do you want to chat about my research? Do you have a great project idea and I am a great fit for the team? Or are you new to Iowa City area and wondering about the best bike paths around? Send me an email or DM on Twitter or connect with me on LinkedIn.
