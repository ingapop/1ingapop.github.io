I am a PhD candidate (graduating December 2021) at the department of Sociology& Criminology at the  University of Iowa. I study emotions, gender, and status in space analog environments (download my CV [here](assets/pdf/inga popovaite_vita_feb_2021.pdf) ). I speak Lithuanian, Russian, and a bit of Georgian and German.  

In my freetime, I bike, swim, read, knit, and make things with Raspberry Pi.   

Are you looking for a data scientist? Contact me and I will tell you why I am the best candidate for the position. 

Do you work in space analogs? Contact me and let's do a project together!
