Hi and welcome!

I am a researcher at [Kaunas University of Technology Faculty of Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities](https://fssah.ktu.edu/).

I recently moved to Kaunas from Iowa City (USA) where I got my PhD from the University of Iowa.

In my research, I explore small group dynamics in space analog environments with a focus on gender and emotions( [here](assets/pdf/inga popovaite_vita_feb_2022.pdf) is my CV). I speak Lithuanian, Russian, and a bit of Georgian and German.  

In my freetime, I bike, swim, read, knit, and make things with Raspberry Pi.   

Contact me if:

* 	You are looking for a data scientist with a strong social / behavioral science background;
* 	You are planning a research project and my expertise would be a great fit;
* 	You want to hear about my personal / research experience in a space analog environment;
* 	You simply want to say hi.
