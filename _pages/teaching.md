My teaching philosophy is grounded in scientific method and centering marginalized voices. The ideal class would have a syllabus that consists of readings beyond texts of white dead men. It would include hands-on approaches to sociology as science (how do we know what we know?) including research ethnics and research politics (whose research matters and how do we challenge that?). 

I want my students to be able to distinguish facts from opinions, and understand relationship between data and discourse.
